# Introducing Linux and Unix

## What is an operating system?
An operating system (OS) is software that:
* Manages computer hardware and resources.
* Allows interaction with hardware to perform useful tasks.

## What is Unix?
**Unix** is a _family of operating systems_. Some popular Unix-based OSs include:
* Oracle Solaris (and Open Solaris)
* FreeBSD
* HP-UX
* IBM AIX
* Apple macOS
  
> [!NOTE]
In the 1960s, the **Unix OS** was rewritten in **C**, distinguishing itself from other systems and making it _portable to many hardware architectures_. And then in the late 1970s, UC Berkley developed **Berkley Software Distribution (BSD)**, an add-on to Unix providing _addtitional software and capabilities_. The famous **macOS** was later dervied from BSD.

## What is Linux?
**Linux** is a _family of Unix-like operating systems_. However, when referring to Linux, people are usually talking about _a specific distribution or flavor_. And Linux was developed as an effort to create a free, **open source** version of the Unix OS.

### Linux features:
* **Free and open source**
  > It means anyone can view the source code.
* **Secure**
  > With so many eyes on the source code, Linux has become the most secure OS over the years.
* **Multi-user**
  > Linux is designed to support multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.
* **Multitasking**
  > Running multiple jobs and applications at the same time.
* **Portability**
  > Linux has been ported to run on many different types of devices and hardware platforms from desktops to servers to appliances.
