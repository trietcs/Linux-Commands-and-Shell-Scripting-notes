# GNU nano
## Features of GNU nano
**GNU nano** is a command-like text editor that provides:
* Undo and redo
* Search and replace
* Syntax highlighting
* Indenting groups of lines
* Line numbers
* Line-by-line scrolling
* Multiple buffers

## Using the GNU nano text editor
To open a text file in GNU nano from the command prompt, type: 
```
nano <filename>
```
This opens a new text editor window in which you can edit the file.


Here is what the nano app looks like:

The main area displays the text of the open file, which in this case is the source text from the nano example page.


The cursor is currently located at the beginning of the file, but you can navigate within the text using the arrow keys, page up and down keys, or `home` and `end` keys. Any text you type is entered at the cursor. You can also delete text using the `Delete` and `Backspace` keys. Pressing `Enter` starts a new line.

At the bottom of the nano window there is a list of commands that you can use in the editor.

To access the commands, simultaneously press `control` and the letter for the command. For example, to **Get Help**, press the `control` and `G` keys

# Vim
**Vim** is a traditional and very powerful command-line editor.
