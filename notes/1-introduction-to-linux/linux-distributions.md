# What is Linux distributions?
**A linux distribution** is _a specific flavor of the Linux OS_. It may also be referred to as _a distro_.

All Linux distributions must use the **Linux kernel**. This is the _core component_ of the Linux OS that enables the system to properly use the computer's hardware.

And today, there are _hundres of Linux distros_, each tailored for a specific audience or task.

# Linux distro differences
Each Linux distro has some of the following key differences: 
* **System utilities**
  > Each Linux distro includes a _unique set of default utilities_ that are part of the OS such as commands and applications that come prepackaged with the distibution.
* **Graphical user interface (GUI)**
  > Each distro has _its own GUI_, that you use to interact with the OS.
* **Shell commands**
  > Each distro supports _a specific set of commands_ that you can use in a shell, a window for entering and receiving output for commands.
* **Support types**
  > Each distro provides differing levels of support such as _Community_ versus enterprise, _Long-term support (LTS)_ versus rolling release.

## Linux distros: Bebian
**Debian** is one of the _earliest-rooted distros_, with the first release in 1993 (named version 0.01) and the first official, stable release in 1996 (version 1.1).
> [!NOTE]
> It is known for being _stable, reliable, and fully open source_.
> 
> It _supports many computer architecture_ (type of hardware).
> 
> Debian is the _largest community-run distro_ currently available.

## Linux distros: Ubuntu
**Ubuntu** is also an early-rooted distro, with its first official release in 2004 (version 4.10)
> [!NOTE]
> Ubuntu is _Debian-based_.
> 
> Developed and managed by _Canonical_.
> 
> Ubuntu has _three official editions_:
> 
> * _Desktop_ (for PCs, laptops, workstations)
> * _Server_ (for simple file servers or multinode clouds)
> * _Core_ (for the Internet of Things IoT)

## Linux distros: Red Hat Linux
**Red Hat Linux**, like Debian, is a _"core"_ Linux distro, meaning that it is not derived from another Linux distro.
> [!NOTE]
> Red Hat is known for being _stable, reliable, and fully open source_.
> 
> Managed by _Red Hat_, an IBM subsidiary.
> 
> Today it ships as _Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)_, an edition focused entirely on enterprise customers.

## Linux distros: Fedora
**Fedora** is known as a stable operating system.
> [!NOTE]
> Supports many architectures.
> 
> Very reliable and secure.
> 
> Actively developed, large community
>
> Sponsored by Red Hat
