# What is Linux distributions?
**A linux distribution** is _a specific flavor of the Linux OS_. It may also be referred to as _a distro_.

All Linux distributions must use the **Linux kernel**. This is the _core component_ of the Linux OS that enables the system to properly use the computer's hardware.

And today, there are _hundres of Linux distros_, each tailored for a specific audience or task.

# Linux distro differences
Each Linux distro has some of the following key differences: 
* **System utilities**
  > Each Linux distro includes a _unique set of default utilities_ that are part of the OS such as commands and applications that come prepackaged with the distibution.
* **Graphical user interface (GUI)**
  > Each distro has _its own GUI_, that you use to interact with the OS.
* **Shell commands**
  > Each distro supports _a specific set of commands_ that you can use in a shell, a window for entering and receiving output for commands.
* **Support types**
  > Each distro provides differing levels of support such as _Community_ versus enterprise, _Long-term support (LTS)_ versus rolling release.
