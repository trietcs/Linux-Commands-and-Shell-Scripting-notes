# Five layers of Linux
![](/images/five-layers-of-linux.png)
The Linux system comprises 5 distinct layers.
* The outermost layer of Linux architecture is the **UI** (or user interface), which allows users to interact with the system using a keyboard or mouse
* The **Application layer** includes _system daemons, shells, user apps, and tools_ used to perform tasks in a Linux system. The applications communicate with the OS to perform tasks.
* The **Operating system** is responsible for jobs that are vital for system stability such as job scheduling and keeping track of time.
* All Linux OS are built on top of the **Linux Kernel**, which performs the most vital lower-level jobs. The kernel is _the core component of the OS_ and is reponsible for managing memory, processing, device drivers, and security.
* The kernal interacts with the **hardware layer**, which includes all the physical or electronic devices in the computer such as CPU, memory (RAM), storage, and input devices.
